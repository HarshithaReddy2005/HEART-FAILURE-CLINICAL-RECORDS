This project aims to build a machine learning-based predictive model using heart failure clinical records to assist in early detection and risk assessment of mortality in patients suffering from heart disease. The dataset used contains real clinical data of patients collected during follow-up medical appointments, including attributes such as age, anaemia status, ejection fraction, serum creatinine, high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, and other vital indicators. The goal is to predict the likelihood of a patient experiencing a fatal heart failure event based on these clinical parameters. The project involves thorough data preprocessing including handling of missing values, normalization of numerical attributes, and encoding of categorical variables. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed to identify key patterns, correlations, and distributions within the dataset, followed by the application of various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Gradient Boosting. Performance of the models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to ensure robust predictions and effective classification. Feature importance analysis was also conducted to identify the most influential factors contributing to heart failure, which could help clinicians in focusing on high-risk indicators. The best-performing model was further optimized through hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation. This project demonstrates how artificial intelligence and machine learning can be leveraged to support clinical decision-making, improve patient outcomes, and potentially save lives by enabling early interventions. The entire pipeline is implemented in Python using libraries like pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn. The approach can be extended or integrated into clinical decision support systems in hospitals or mobile health applications for proactive heart disease monitoring.

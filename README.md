# ‚ù§Ô∏è Heart Failure Clinical Records - Mortality Risk Prediction

This project aims to build a machine learning-based predictive model using heart failure clinical records to assist in early detection and risk assessment of mortality in patients suffering from heart disease. The dataset used contains real clinical data of patients collected during follow-up medical appointments, including attributes such as age, anaemia status, ejection fraction, serum creatinine, and more.

The project focuses on extracting meaningful patterns from the data, dealing with imbalanced classes, and evaluating the effectiveness of multiple classification algorithms in predicting patient survival.
